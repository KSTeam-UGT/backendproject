OVERVIEW
We believe in believing in ourselves. And we believe in you! Sometimes all we need is a little push in the right direction to quantum leap into the next level of our lives. We can do this by filling our spaces with positivity, motivation and resources to help us get there. What better place to start than with our site, yougotthis.com. Start by completing your personal profile and we’ll provide resources that can help you achieve your goal whether it’s to beat procrastination, stay focused and more. We believe you got this! 

GOALS
1) Collaborate successfully on our project by using the tools we have available to us through the course and the skills we’ve learned in the past few weeks. 
2) Launch a minimum viable product that provides ease of use and a pleasant UI for an optimal end user experience.

MILESTONES

Team Members and Roles:
Handling the fun task of beautifying our product by ensuring the UI is easy on the eyes we have Maria and Kasheena as our Front End/Design Team. Keeping everything pieced together on the back end is Steve, our Back End Engineer with support from Ginger. Lastly, Product Managing and API/Data Engineering is Ginger with support from Steve. 

Software Concept And Goal:
Our site, yougotthis.com, will leverage the following APIs:
Universal Inspirational Quotes API
Site can send a daily inspirational quote directly to your inbox using…
Mailgun
Used for purposes of mailing resources
YouTube 
To send a motivational video 
Open Library
Find the right book on personal improvement
For programming we’ll use HTML and CSS, Django and Python. 

Potential Challenges:
While the APIs are available, we would need to make sure we can map to the profile created by the end user and not just provide results at random.

User Stories:
1) As a person interested in self improvement, I can create a profile and have self improvement resources sent directly to me or kept on my user profile.
2) As an end user of the site, I am able to log in and see my profile, make changes to my profile and save these changes.
3) As an end user of the site, I can specify what type of resources are sent to me.
4) As a recipient of self help resources, I can mark a self help tool as a favorite in my profile to access later

For workflow please refer to the shared doc sent in the HW channel.
